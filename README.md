### Info
_Poop Cleaner Bot_ is a bot that helps you manage spam on a telegram group thanks to the support of group members. 
When a message gets a predetermined number of reactions of type \"üí©\" the bot deletes the message from the group.

### Bot
First of all you need to create a bot with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).  
Then, you need to:
- disable _privacy mode_ for the bot (through Bot Father), to allow the bot to read all messages.
- add the bot to your group as admin (only _deletion_ permission required).

### Configuration
Copy [.env.sample](./.env.sample) in `.env` and edit the file with own configs.

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=here_your_telegram_username
ADMIN_LIGHTNING_ADDRESS=here_your_lightning_address
BOT_TOKEN=here_your_telegram_bot_token
DEBUG=0
POOP_THRESHOLD=10
```
  
`ADMIN_USERNAME`: (optional) your personal telegram username.  
`ADMIN_LIGHTNING_ADDRESS`: (optional) your personal lightning network address.  
`BOT_TOKEN`: (mandatory) the token of your telegram bot.  
`DEBUG`: (optional) enable/disable debug mode (0 for False, 1 for True).  
`POOP_THRESHOLD`: (mandatory) minimum number of reaction for deleting a message.

### Usage
The easiest way to use the bot is via the [docker compose](./docker-compose.yml) file. When ready, run:
```
docker compose up -d 
```
